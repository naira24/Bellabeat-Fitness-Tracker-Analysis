##  Bellabeat Data Analysis Project 📈

This project involves analyzing fitness tracker data from Bellabeat users to derive insights and provide data-driven recommendations for marketing and product strategy.

### 🎯 Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to analyze user activity, sleep, and weight data to understand user behavior and identify opportunities for Bellabeat to enhance its products, target its audience more effectively, and improve its marketing strategies.

### 📊 Data Sources

The analysis is based on the following datasets:

-   `DailyActivity.csv`: Contains daily activity metrics such as steps, distance, active minutes (very, fairly, lightly, sedentary), and calories burned.
-   `SleepDay.csv`: Provides daily sleep records, including total sleep records, total minutes asleep, and total time in bed.
-   `WeightLogInfo.csv`: Includes user-logged weight information, such as weight in kg and pounds, height, and fat percentage.

### ✨ Key Insights & Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following insights have been identified:

-   **Activity Goal Achievement:** Approximately 45.75% of users did not meet the 150-minute Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity (MVPA) goal. Bellabeat can leverage active minutes as a health metric and send reminders to users to help them meet their weekly targets.
-   **Sedentary Behavior:** A significant portion of time (79.98%) is spent in sedentary activities. Bellabeat can recommend customized exercise plans to attract new customers and enhance its marketing strategy.
